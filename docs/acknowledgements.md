# Acknowledgements

## The Team
noCTF is developed by a team initially consisting of DownUnderCTF organisers, however we operate
independently and do not receive direct support from DownUnderCTF itself.

The main development team consists of:
- [Tom Nguyen](https://github.com/lecafard)
- [Joseph Surin](https://github.com/josephsurin)
- [Sam Calamos](https://github.com/bluealder)

## Additional Thanks
We would like to thank [Tanto Security](https://tantosec.com) and
[Justin Steven](https://github.com/justinsteven) for kindly providing us with a pentest of the noCTF
codebase. 

Additionally we would like to thank the DownUnderCTF Organisers for providing continuous feedback
on the system.

## License
All code in noCTF is licensed under the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
license meaning that you are free to modify the code any way you wish, and use it for both personal
and commercial purposes, in line with the terms of the license.

That being said, we kindly ask that you do not use noCTF as the basis for a commercial
CTF-as-a-service platform i.e. services that host CTFs on behalf of third parties for profit (such
as commercial training platforms or resold event infrastructure).

This is a non-binding request, and we acknowledge that the Apache 2.0 license permits such usage.
However, we hope that users will respect the intent of the project: to support the broader CTF
community and educational institutions.

Examples of usage that aligns with the spirit of this project include:
- Community or student-run CTF competitions
- Private and open-to-public corporate CTF events
- Events hosted by educational institutions
- Private or nonprofit CTFs run within an organization or team

If you're unsure whether your use case aligns with this intent, feel free to reach out via GitHub
for clarification.
